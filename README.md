## üß™ Unit Testing

Unit testing is a crucial aspect of ensuring the reliability and functionality of individual components in the application. In this project, we have implemented unit tests for various repository methods to verify their correctness. Some key aspects of our unit testing approach include:

- **Isolation**: Each test is designed to focus on a single functionality, ensuring that individual components perform as expected.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover all critical functions such as creating, updating, and retrieving records from the database.
- **Spring Boot Context**: Tests run within the Spring Boot context, allowing for integration testing with actual database interactions.
- **Assertions**: Use of assertions to validate the expected outcomes of each test case, ensuring the application behaves correctly.

### Example Test Cases

- **Add Customer Query**: Verifies that a new customer query can be added to the repository.
- **Answer Customer Query**: Ensures that answers can be provided for existing customer queries.
- **List Customer Queries**: Checks that the list of customer queries can be retrieved successfully.
- **Add Public Query**: Confirms that a public query can be added to the repository.
- **List Public Queries**: Ensures that the list of public queries can be retrieved successfully.
